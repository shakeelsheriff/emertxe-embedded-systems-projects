# Emertxe Advanced Embedded Systems Projects

This repository contains 7 projects developed as part of the Advanced Embedded Systems course at **Emertxe Information Technologies** (Feb 2024 – Present).  
Projects cover **Embedded C**, **Advanced C programming**, **PIC microcontroller**, **Linux Internals**, and **Data Structures**.

## 📂 Project List
1. **LSB Image Steganography** – Embed and retrieve text in an image using LSB manipulation. *(Advanced C, File Handling, Bitwise Ops)*
2. **MP3 Tag Reader** – Read and modify MP3 metadata (ID3 tags) via CLI. *(Advanced C, File I/O, Pointers)*
3. **Lexical Analyzer** – Tokenize C source code for keywords, literals, and directives. *(Advanced C, Data Structures)*
4. **Source-to-HTML Converter** – Syntax-highlight C code in HTML/CSS. *(Advanced C, HTML, CSS)*
5. **Car Black Box Prototype** – Log vehicle events in real-time using PIC16F877A. *(Embedded C, UART, I2C)*
6. **Minishell** – Minimal Linux shell supporting built-in commands and signal handling. *(C, Linux System Calls, IPC)*
7. **Inverted Index Search** – Keyword-based file search using linked lists and hash tables. *(Advanced C, DSA)*
